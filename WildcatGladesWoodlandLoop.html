        <h3>Problem Description</h3>

        <p>A professor from Missouri Southern State University has a project planned to monitor the effect of removing invasive plant species from a section of woodland. The plan is to remove invasive plant species from Study Area 1 and use Study Area 2 as control. 
            He wanted fifteen points placed quasi-randomly throughout each area with them being reasonably spaced from one another.

        <h3>Problem Solving Process</h3>

        <p>
            I first created line features to map out the trails in the area as I couldn't find them online. Then I created polygonal features for each study area where it was described to me. To get the fifteen points, I subdivided each area into fifteen
             subsections and found the centroid for each. To make it easy for the professor to locate these points, I exported them as .GPX files for easy use in a handheld GPS device.
